In this repo, we present some python scripts to explore **`typer`**, a library for building command-line interfaces (CLIs) in Python. It includes the following folders:

- 📁 **cli_arguments**: Contains examples on how to define and handle CLI Arguments (positional arguments) in a CLI.

- 📁 **cli_option**: Contains examples on how to define and handle CLI Options (also known as flags or switches) in a CLI.

- 📁 **commands**: Contains examples on how to define and handle subcommands in a CLI.

- 📁 **example_1**: Contains some simple example CLIs built with `typer`, with a comparison to the same CLIs built using the `argparse` library.

- 📁 **example_2**: Contains another example CLI built with `typer`, with a comparison to the same CLI built using the `argparse` library.

- 📁 **help**: Contains examples on how to define and customize the help text displayed in the CLI.

- 📁 **rich**: Contains examples on how to use the `rich` library with `typer` to add formatting and other enhancements to the output of the CLI.
